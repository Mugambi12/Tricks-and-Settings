# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game written in Python. The player has to guess the letters of a secret word before running out of guesses.

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    - For Linux: [https://github.com/your_username/hangman-game.git](https://github.com/your_username/hangman-game.git)

    - For Windows: [https://github.com/your_username/hangman-game.git](https://github.com/your_username/hangman-game.git)

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the game is located.

3. Run the game by typing `python hangman.py` in the terminal.

4. The game will ask you to enter a word for someone else to guess, and then start the game.

5. You have to guess letters one by one until you have guessed all the letters in the word, or you run out of guesses.

6. If you guess a letter correctly, it will be displayed in the word.

7. If you guess a letter incorrectly, a part of the hangman will be displayed. You only have 3 incorrect guesses before you lose the game.

8. If you want to guess the entire word, type the word when prompted for a letter.

9. If you guess the word correctly, you can continue guessing letters until you have guessed all the letters in the word.

10. If you run out of guesses, the game is over and the correct word is displayed.

Good luck and have fun!
